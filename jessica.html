									<h3 class="major">Jessica Van Ranken</h3>
									<p>Jessica Van Ranken is a junior studying Political Science, Pre-Law, with a minor in Business, and hails from Lindsborg, Kansas. Her passion for K-State has been fostered by deep involvement in a variety of student organizations, such as Sigma Kappa Sorority, Relay For Life of K-State, Union Governing Board, Panhellenic Council and a particular drive for Student Governing Association. She has always thrived on the opportunity to engage in organizations that impact those around her, and that has led to her love for SGA and the work that it does and can do for students. </p>

									<p>Jessica began her time in SGA as an intern her freshman year, then was a student senator her sophomore year, and currently serves as Speaker Pro Tem of the legislative branch. As Speaker Pro Tem, she assists the Speaker in the functions and vision of the legislative branch, as well as the membership and development of student senate. Jessica believes that she is incredibly capable of taking on the role of Student Body President because of her experience within and enthusiasm for both SGA and K-State. She and Trenton are willing and eager to address any issues affecting K-State students, particularly relating to their campaignâ€™s three themes: mental wellness, diversity and political advocacy.</p>
