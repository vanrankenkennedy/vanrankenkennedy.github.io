									<h3 class="major">How We Got Started</h3>
									<p>Since starting their journey as K-State students, Jessica and Trenton's individual passion for the university has seen constant growth. This year, that passion transformed into a shared vision for how K-State can see growth through the ideas and enthusiasm that they can bring to the offices of Student Body President and Vice President. Both feel strongly committed to the cause of student success, and came together to address that cause through meaningful action. They were drawn together because of a shared excitement for K-State and a drive to work to bring intentional change for students. </p>

									<p>When you ask Jessica and Trenton about how they well they work together, there are definitely some common themes. When asked about working with Jessica, Trenton said “I think the best thing about working side by side with Jessica, and the thought of doing it for a whole year, is that our shared love and passion for the university and community at large translates into an amazing work ethic that allows us to see measurable change and impact on a daily basis, even if sometimes on the minute level.”</p>

									<p>Trenton and Jessica, while both passionate about themselves and the work they have done, are more excited about the platforms and the work they will do, and have already done on behalf of the student body. “This year and this election we will see a chance for students across the K-State community to vote not just for candidates, but for ideas and work that they believe will make K-State stronger together,” Jessica said when asked about the campaign. </p>
