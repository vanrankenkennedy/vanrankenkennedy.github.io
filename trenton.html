									<h3 class="major">Trenton Kennedy</h3>
									<p>Trenton Kennedy is a sophomore at K-State originally from Frankfort, Kansas. He is pursuing a degree in entrepreneurship with a minor in political science. Trentonâ€™s K-State story is one that is both unique, and fateful. After visiting multiple schools across the country, he paid one visit to the Manhattan campus and knew where he would call home. For him, it was an undeniable sense of place and community on campus that shaped his decision then, and almost every decision today. When arriving on campus in August of 2014, Trent got involved in a multitude of things including Beta Theta Pi Fraternity, Quest Freshman Honorary and he served as an SGA Intern. It was during his time as an intern that he developed a love and passion for SGA and student senate. </p>

									<p>After spending the summer of 2015 working in Washington, D.C., Trent returned to campus to serve as the intern program coordinator within SGA, where he had the opportunity to influence the SGA careers of 25 newcomers, equipping them for further leadership and involved in K-State SGA. Also in the fall of his sophomore year, Jessica Van Ranken approached him to work on the beginnings of what we now call Van Ranken-Kennedy. It was during the first six months of tedious planning, strategizing, meetings with campus administrators and deep personal experiences that Trenton and Jessica created a game plan to positively influence and change for better and forever, the university they both are so incredibly proud to call home.</p>
